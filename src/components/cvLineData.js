          The course by <a href={'http://wtmberlin.com'}>WTM Berlin</a> is
          designed for introducing JavaScript and Node.js as a platform for
          backend applications. In its current stage my project is a Node.js
          application using the following technologies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>implements RESTful APIs with Express.js</li>
          <li>
            data is stored in a MongoDB Datastore, the object modeling is done
            in Mongoose
          </li>
          <li>unit testing is done using the test runner Ava</li>
          <li>
            the frontend is built in React.js, the App is deployed with Docker
            on Heroku
          </li>
        </ul>
